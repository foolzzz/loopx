"""End-to-end host contract for the Antigravity CLI (agy) surface.

Installing discoverable files is not the same as being a usable LoopX host. The
generated `/loopx` facade tells the agent to run `start-goal ... --host-surface
<exact-current-host>`, so these tests execute that path for real and separately
verify that an omitted host selects the Codex CLI default.
