"""Assemble matrix.json from the fixture layout with gold labels frozen here.

Gold labels are written before any provider call and are not edited after a
run. Constructed cases are authored by the conversation author; real commits
are merged upstream changes whose acceptance is restated from their commit
message, so their on-goal label comes from the upstream merge, not from us.
