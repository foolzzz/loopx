# Changelog

This file records the changes of this LoopX fork. The fork branched from
upstream [`loopx-project/loopx`](https://github.com/loopx-project/loopx) at
`71dbfd5e6` (2026-09-26) and no longer tracks upstream
([design-v0](docs/fork/design-v0.md)). For upstream history before that
point, see the upstream releases and [docs/update-notes](docs/update-notes/README.md).

The fork's first release is `2.0.0` (tag `v2.0.0`). It moves past the upstream
`1.2.0` it branched from, because the role-based orchestration model changes
how a goal runs. Changes after a release are listed under **Unreleased** until
the next tag. Pull request numbers in the 2.0.0 entry refer to
[michaelx1993/loopx](https://github.com/michaelx1993/loopx/pulls).

To learn how to use these features, read the [usage guide](docs/fork/usage.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- The source path-literal regression guard now decodes JS/TS, shell ANSI-C and
  PowerShell escapes, folds Python/JS constant additions and joins shell word
  parts. PowerShell expressions remain unevaluated. Decoded
  per-file/value budgets still reject new values, duplicates and moved literals;
  existing test, prose and path-owner exclusions remain unchanged.

### Removed

- Retired the Release Artifacts workflow, its package identity/checksum script,
  and workflow-only validation. Automatic wheel/sdist asset upload, package
  attestations, and optional PyPI publication are no longer provided. Installed
  Chat wheel/sdist HTTP and browser validation now run in the existing frontend
  qualification CI; local release readiness remains available.
- Retired the scheduled Update Notes workflow, draft generator, generator-only
  smoke, and automation guide. Historical notes and their public-boundary smoke
  remain available.
- Removed the native desktop client, Tauri shell, signed update/repair/rollback
  UI, desktop release workflows, and their bundling, signing, feed, and validation
  helpers. Use `loopx dashboard` for the browser/PWA workspace; Settings and
  Goal navigation remain available.
- **Wire change:** `loopx doctor` no longer returns `desktop_installation` or
  the `desktop_app_runtime_pairing` check. CLI installation, release provenance,
  freshness, and managed-service diagnostics remain supported.
- Removed the repository benchmark workspace, legacy benchmark archive and
  frozen experiment snapshots, with their archive-only tests and path exclusions.
  Canary plan selection no longer emits `active_scan_changed_files` or
  `excluded_changed_files`; `changed_files` is the sole file selector.
- Removed the SWE-Marathon, LHTB and DeepSWE public research pages, homepage
  research cards, study metadata and share-bundle exports without redirects.
  The provider-neutral benchmark toolkit, CLI and managed skill remain available.
- Removed OpenCode (including OpenCode 2), Kiro CLI, Gemini CLI, and Cline
  host integrations: activation profiles and aliases, goal bridge/worker,
  Chat endpoint, installer targets, command packs, and project-skill surfaces.
  Removed `opencode2-goal-worker`, `--with-goal-bridge`, `--opencode-home`,
  `--gemini-home`, and Chat/Dashboard `--kiro-cli-bin`. The default slash-command
  installation now targets Codex and Claude Code only. Codex CLI/app-server,
  Claude Code, Cursor Agent, Pi, dsh, Ark and custom runner routes remain.
- Removed the implicit OpenCode connector for visible `generic-cli` host-mode
  plans. A generic visible identity now fails closed; explicit Pi still uses
  `pi_goal_loop` with the generic-cli Turn adapter.
- Removed the automated Frontstage Pages workflow, its GitHub stargazer-history
  fetch/render helpers, the README star-history image, and workflow-only smokes.
  Presentation sources, local builds, static exports, and browser validation
  remain available; hosted Pages publication is no longer a repository check.

- Removed the unused synthetic `loopx.visible_governance` projection and its
  dedicated smoke. It had no product or CLI consumer; existing status, quota,
  task-lease, and decision-scope contracts remain unchanged.
- Removed the bundled Doubao model-behavior actors and live qualification
  commands, including Claude/Doubao and host-prompt probes. Provider-neutral
  packet/oracle tests and real CLI/shell regressions remain.
- Removed `doubao_actual_default` from the exact release qualification
  manifest's required receipt set and summary schemas; the remaining release
  checks still fail closed. Retired receipts are rejected as unknown ids.
- Removed the computer-use runtime protocol, schemas, independent validator,
  fixture smoke, catalog references, and canary registration.

- Removed duplicate project-state and Codex-home path construction from runtime,
  CLI, Chat, Lark and installation readback consumers. They use `loopx.paths`
  without changing path layout, environment precedence or explicit overrides.
  A source-level pytest budget prevents new raw path literals outside that owner.
- Removed the source-checkout `demo/` workspace and research/visible-agent
  launchers, together with their dedicated validation and documentation.
- Retired the `loopx auto-research` and `loopx multi-agent` command trees,
  including installed-build stubs; both now fail as unknown commands. Core
  collaboration, `loopx workspace`, and `loopx deepresearch` remain available.
- Replaced the standalone CLI module size and command ownership smoke with
  `tests/architecture/test_cli_command_module_ownership.py`, collected by
  pytest. Existing line budgets and registration ownership assertions are
  unchanged.
- Removed the retired `local_authority_shadow` post-commit observation feature:
  its Goal settings/catalog entry, `--local-authority-shadow-file` and
  `--clear-local-authority-shadow` options, the `.record` runtime method, and
  historical observation reads. Configuration summaries no longer contain
  `local_authority_shadow`; state migration no longer returns
  `authority_shadow_seeds`. Existing observation files are left untouched.
- Removed the `authority-shadow` CLI. Transaction-bound outbox recovery and
  status now use `coordination-shadow drain` and `coordination-shadow status`.
  These responses use `loopx_coordination_shadow_io_cli_v0` and omit the retired
  `historical_only` field; status `config` reports active runtime-shadow settings.
  Active runtime-shadow capture, qualification, promotion, provider defaults,
  transaction schemas and persisted lineage identities are unchanged.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-10-07

### Changed

- Retired the Full Public Smokes GitHub workflow and its workflow-only smoke.
  Full public sweeps and compact health reports remain available through
  explicit CLI runs; CI no longer aggregates receipts from a skipped job.

- **Monitor timestamps use a stable cross-language ISO grammar.** Python and
  TypeScript retain reduced-time fractional seconds (`T00.1`), reject hour 24
  and UTC year overflow, and preserve exact microsecond ordering independently
  of the host Python minor version. Monitor schedule generation now uses this
  same codec instead of JavaScript's permissive date parser. Focused CI covers
  Python 3.11 and 3.14.

- **The retired App scheduler contract has been removed from the typed core.**
  This is a breaking wire and CLI cleanup with no compatibility aliases.
  - Runtime profile enum values `codex_app_heartbeat` and `trae_app`, and host
    surface values `codex_app` and `trae_app`, are no longer accepted.
  - `quota should-run --codex-app`, `heartbeat-prompt --trae_app`,
    `--codex-app-current-rrule`, and `--app-automation-current-rrule` have been
    removed.
  - Scheduler output no longer emits `codex_app`, `app_automation`,
    App-applicability placeholders, RRULE recommendations, cadence guarantees,
    stateful App backoff, or App pause/delete host actions.
  - The App-specific settlement plan/source is removed. Generic CLI callers
    retain provider-neutral, turn-scoped settlement and must provide an explicit
    turn identity. Host-specific scheduler mutation remains provider-owned.
- **LoopX state no longer lives under Codex's directory.** This is a breaking
  path change with no migration.
  - The global runtime root moves from `~/.codex/loopx` to `~/.loopx`. It
    holds the global registry (`registry.global.json`), `providers.yaml`,
    `agents/`, `dispatch/`, `chat/`, per-goal runtime state under `goals/`,
    backups and extension state.
  - Project goal state moves from `<project>/.codex/goals/<goal>/` to
    `<project>/.loopx/goals/<goal>/`, next to the project's `registry.json`
    and `agents/`. A project now only needs `.loopx/` (and `.local/`) ignored
    by Git.
  - LoopX does not read, fall back to or migrate the old directories, and
    `loopx backup-state` and the orphaned-goal-state check no longer look at
    `.codex/goals`. To keep existing state, stop LoopX and move it by hand:
    `~/.codex/loopx` to `~/.loopx`, and each project's `.codex/goals/` to
    `.loopx/goals/`. A registry entry whose `state_file` names an explicit
    path keeps using that path. Codex's own files (`~/.codex/config.toml`,
    `~/.codex/skills`, `CODEX_HOME`) are unchanged.
- **`LOOPX_RUNTIME_ROOT` sets the default runtime root through one
  resolver.** Before, only a few call sites read it. Now every LoopX command,
  module and script that needs a runtime root and is given none reads it
  through `loopx.paths.default_runtime_root()`, at the moment the root is
  used. `--runtime-root` and a registry's `common_runtime_root` still take
  precedence. An unset or blank value means `~/.loopx`. A relative value is
  made absolute against the current directory.
  - Commands that LoopX renders for another shell (agent prompts and SSH
    commands) name the global registry as
    `"${LOOPX_RUNTIME_ROOT:-$HOME/.loopx}/registry.global.json"`. The shell
    that runs the command expands it, so a relative value resolves against
    that shell's working directory, and whitespace is not trimmed.
  - The macOS dashboard launch agents resolve the registry and runtime root
    with the same resolver at install time. When `LOOPX_RUNTIME_ROOT` is set,
    they export it to both services.
  - Lark consumer leases are machine-scoped. They live under the default
    runtime root (`LOOPX_RUNTIME_ROOT` or `~/.loopx`), whatever a service's
    `--runtime-root`, so one bot App has one consumer per machine.
  - Exceptions: the KunlunCode goal mode and the benchmark runner keep their
    own path literals. Both are being removed.
- **Reward Memory refresh outcome candidates are host-neutral.** New candidate
  responses and private sidecars use the `refresh_outcome_candidate` schema,
  storage path and receipt names instead of `codex_app_outcome`. Existing
  sidecars with the old Codex App schema and storage path remain readable, but
  every new write uses the new names.

### Fixed

- **Concurrent release smoke cleans up installer process trees.** Timeout,
  assertion and spawn failures now stop all started installers and their
  children before temporary state is removed. Promotion checks and their
  existing wait budgets remain unchanged.
- **Default promotion serializes Chat bundle preparation.** The existing
  install guard is acquired before rebuilding or carrying forward checkout
  assets, preventing concurrent installers from replacing the same bundle.
  Canary-only installation keeps its existing path without this guard.
- **Global manager CLI errors stay public-safe.** `global-gates`, `global-todos`
  and `global-risks` now reach their command-local error handlers when the
  registry is unavailable or invalid, returning JSON or Markdown errors with
  local paths redacted instead of an unhandled traceback.
- **Global registry permission failures remain structured.** Sync now reports
  `write_denied` with repair guidance when acquiring the cross-runtime registry
  lock is denied, including a lock-only permission failure. Successful syncs
  retain the same locked source refresh and registry transaction. `connect`
  and `register-agent` acquire that fence before committing local state and
  reuse it through synchronization, so denied locks leave source state intact.
- **Native Codex benchmark receipt identity.** The
  `loopx_native_codex_goal_profile_v1` receipt replaces v0 `host_surface` with
  separate `experiment_arm`, `runtime_profile`, and `execution_host` fields.
  The historical `ssh-goal` arm now records `codex_cli` and
  `codex-app-server` without conflating the runtime contract with its transport.
- **HOME-rooted Goal state no longer overlaps machine runtime state.** When a
  project root and runtime root would both use `<home>/.loopx/goals`, newly
  bootstrapped Goals store their project-owned state under
  `<home>/.loopx/project-goals` instead. Uninstalling a Goal created with the
  old overlapping layout and `--archive-state` now archives only its
  `ACTIVE_GOAL_STATE.md`; runtime-owned receipts and other files remain in the
  runtime Goal directory.
- **Goals without a code repository.** A goal created with `loopx goal
  create` and no `--repo` now runs under the dispatcher. Before, every
  developer and acceptor Turn on a todo without `task_repositories` failed
  its writeback ("accountable peer delivery must be refreshed from the
  independent git worktree"), in a git project directory or not, and the
  `goal_complete` gate never opened for a project directory that is not a
  git repository.
  - One typed rule decides where a delivery must come from, for both
    refresh-state and the `quota should-run` workspace guard. Under role_v1,
    a developer or acceptor todo that names no repository delivers from the
    goal's project directory. A todo that names a repo is still refused
    there.
  - Because nothing isolates them, the dispatcher runs at most one developer
    or acceptor Turn on such todos per goal. The others skip with
    `project_directory_turn_running`, shown in the pass and in `loopx
    dispatch status`. Orchestrator Turns and Turns on todos with repos are
    unaffected.
  - Push planning reports the implicit repo as `not_a_git_repo` when the
    project directory is not a git repository, or `no_commits` when it has
    no commit yet, skipped like a repo without a remote. The `goal_complete`
    gate uses the same classification, so it lists the directory as local
    only.

  See [Goals without a code repository](docs/fork/usage.md#goals-without-a-code-repository)
  for what works and the limits: no isolation, no delivery snapshot, no
  merge, no rollback and no push gate. Known limitation: the one-Turn slot
  follows the `turn run-once` process, not its host, and two goals that
  share a project directory are not kept apart.

### Removed

- **v0.1 main/side hierarchy migration.** `configure-goal` no longer accepts
  `--ack-automation-prompt-migration`, and the one-time migration module,
  completion receipt, and migration smoke are removed. Goals that still carry
  `legacy_hierarchy`, `primary_agent`, `side_agent_handoff_agent`,
  `agent_profile_v0`, or profile-level hierarchy policy now fail before
  identity or routing with the rejected field paths and cleanup instructions.
  Current `role_v1` and `peer_v1` goals still require a registered `--agent-id`.

- **Codex App over SSH host surface and implicit Turn creation.** The
  `codex-app-ssh` agent/host surface, `codex_app_ssh` scheduler surface and
  `codex_app_ssh_goal` runtime profile are removed. Native Codex benchmark
  paths now use the supported `codex_cli` profile. The `quota --begin-turn`
  option is also removed; callers that need accountable Turn settlement must
  pass one stable, host-owned `--turn-instance-id` and reuse it on retries.
- **KunlunCode integration.** The `loopx-kunluncode` command and its
  `loopx.kunluncode_goal_mode` package (native Goal Pro controller, managed
  MCP server, outer-controller write guard) are gone, together with the
  `kunluncode` agent type, the `kunluncode` scheduler runtime profile and
  host surface, and the KunlunCode adapter guide. `LOOPX_KUNLUNCODE_OUTER_CONTROLLER`
  no longer has any effect. A persisted scheduler context or `--runtime-profile`
  that still names `kunluncode` is now reported as unsupported.
- **NoKV authority provider candidate.** The Stage 2A NoKV candidate had no
  CLI or runtime entry point and is retired. Removed:
  - the TypeScript `NoKVAuthorityStore` and its JSONL transport, the Python
    `nokv_jsonl_helper`, and the `nokv` provider profile;
  - the `nokv-shadow-provider` and `nokv-authority-store` examples;
  - the NoKV unit, transport and qualification-harness tests and their fake
    SDK fixtures.

  The shared-authority E2E ladder loses its `s0.nokv_live_matrix` and
  `s2a.nokv_live_qualification` rows, the `env:nokv_*` gates, stage `2a`, and
  the `nokv_client_config_sha256` and `nokv_sdk_version` report bindings. Its
  Stage 0 file matrix now runs in-process from
  `loopx/control_plane/testing/authority_e2e_file_matrix.py`. The
  provider-neutral coordination contract probes moved to
  `tests/control_plane/test_coordination_contract_probes.py`. An authority
  archive whose header names `nokv` as its source provider is now rejected.
- **Documentation-text and dead example smokes (developer-facing).** 49
  example files are removed:
  - 25 smokes that only matched document wording, with their two orphaned
    fixtures and `cs-notes-integration.example.md`;
  - 21 smokes and example files that could no longer run or only tested
    their own fixtures. These include the four `/?view=ops` dashboard browser
    smokes, eight transitional `cli-*-command-modularization` shape checks,
    the handoff read-model and protocol-action-packet smokes, and the
    already-failing `todo-index-rollout-status` smoke.

  The canary planner no longer schedules two smokes that did not exist
  (three catalog entries): `worker-bridge-install-contract-smoke.py` and
  `control_plane/run-compaction-readmodel-smoke.py`. The planner smoke now
  checks a selection table and whole-catalog invariants instead of pinning
  individual smoke paths.
- **Example smokes duplicated by pytest or wired only to documents
  (developer-facing).** 37 more example files are removed:
  - 14 smokes whose assertions already live in named pytest tests, with
    their fixtures;
  - the catalog-wired documentation and duplicate smokes, with their fixtures:
    event-store migration bridge, interaction-scheduler authority, local
    state-write correctness contract, review packet, todo-detail cold path,
    global-manager command and rollback-packet protocols, canary promotion
    no-write contract, frontstage rollout projections, host integration
    surface, issue-fix capability guide, the periodic-report set, the
    progress-review sentinel, and the extension placement doc.

  The canary planner, qualification and release profiles, the quality-surface
  catalog, and the `periodic_report` and `progress_review` capability catalog
  entries drop those commands. Where a capability needs a check, it now names
  the equivalent pytest command.
- **Codex App automation tooling (first step of the Codex App and Trae App
  removal).** LoopX no longer reads or edits the Codex App automation store.
  Removed:
  - the `automation-prompts` command;
  - the installed-prompt upgrade that `update --apply` ran after installing.
    `update --apply` now only installs and checks the runtime; its payload no
    longer has `automation_prompt_upgrade` or `upgrade_complete`;
  - the turn-start prompt-upgrade hint;
  - the `loopx-apply-rrule` fallback executable (`scripts/codex_app_apply_rrule.py`),
    the `fallback_hint` it was projected through, and the installer steps
    that installed it. An existing `~/.local/bin/loopx-apply-rrule` link is
    left in place; remove it by hand;
  - reading the installed heartbeat RRULE from `$CODEX_HOME/automations` during
    `quota should-run` and `scheduler-fail-current`;
  - `upgrade-plan`, which only planned Codex App heartbeat prompt upgrades;
  - `backup-state --no-automations` and the `$CODEX_HOME/automations`
    backup target;
  - the Codex App guides and runtime pages outside the pinned dev book.
- **App scheduler ACK and failure follow-up.** LoopX no longer records which
  RRULE a Codex App or Trae App heartbeat applied. Removed:
  - the `quota scheduler-ack`, `scheduler-ack-current` and
    `scheduler-fail-current` commands and their flags (`--surface`,
    `--state-key`, `--applied-rrule`, `--failed-rrule`,
    `--host-match-observed`, `--failure-kind`, `--reset-token`,
    `--identity-signature`, `--use-current-hint`,
    `--scheduler-host-facts-chunk`);
  - `scheduler_hint.app_automation.ack_hint` and `failure_hint`, their
    `scheduler_hint.codex_app` copies and CLI route binding, and the Turn
    envelope's `ack_cli_args` and `*_detail_ref` fields;
  - `ack_cli_args` and `failure_cli_args` in `EffectTurn.next_effect`;
  - the native Node fast path for those commands in the `loopx` launchers
    (`scripts/loopx`, `scripts/loopx.ps1`, the console entry point) and its
    TypeScript transaction;
  - the obsolete App cadence progression/ACK/failure transition runtime,
    failure-cache helpers, canonical enums, and characterization fixtures;
  - the producer of `user_gate_notification_cooldown_v0`, which only fired
    after a failed App cadence update;
  - the `quota_scheduler_ack` run classification. Run rows with it that an
    older release wrote are no longer treated as quota-neutral.

  LoopX no longer reads or writes App scheduler state, so each poll projects
  the App cadence from the profile's initial interval. The App state files
  under `<runtime_root>/goals/<goal>/scheduler-state/<agent>/codex_app-*/` and
  `.../trae_app-*/` are orphaned and can be deleted by hand; there is no
  migration. Keep `scheduler-state/owner-policy-*/`, which holds the
  automation cadence policy. The canary `scheduler-ack-route` surface and
  profile become `scheduler-cadence`.
- **Codex App, Trae App and Codex IDE plugin as onboarding hosts.** LoopX no
  longer onboards or activates these hosts. Removed:
  - the `codex-app`, `trae_app` and `codex-ide-plugin` agent types and their
    aliases (`codex_app`, `codex desktop`, `codex-ide`, `vscode codex` and the
    rest) from `agent-onboard`, `agent-onboard --list-agent-types` and host
    loop activation, with their activation packets and the App-only
    `automation_cadence_json` command;
  - `codex-app`, `trae_app`, `codex-ide-plugin`, `codex-ide` and `chat-box`
    as `start-goal --host-surface`, `bootstrap-command-pack --host-surface`
    and `slash-commands --surface` values. They now fail as unsupported;
  - the guided-start `scheduler_ack_when_needed` step, which only acked an
    App automation RRULE;
  - reading `TRAECLI_THREAD_ID` as the ambient thread id;
  - the `codex_app_loop_surface` and `codex_app_default_heartbeat_cadence`
    fields of the `codex-cli-bootstrap-message` JSON payload;
  - the Codex App host command registry protocol and its smoke, and the Codex
    App plugin plan;
  - the App host rows and instructions in the `/loopx` command, the
    `loopx-project` skill, the goal-start contract, the project prompts,
    getting-started, the newcomer guide and the README host tables.

  Default changes:
  - `bootstrap-command-pack --host-surface` defaults to `codex-cli-tui`
    (was `codex-app`), and a missing host surface resolves to `codex-cli`.
  - Bare `codex`, `openai-codex` and `openai codex` now resolve to
    `codex-cli`. Before, they failed as ambiguous. Bare `cli` is still
    ambiguous.
  - Beginner preset commands pass `--runtime-profile codex_cli` (was
    `codex_app_heartbeat`).

  No migration is provided for removed App host values; bind the thread again
  from a supported host. Codex App over SSH (`codex-app-ssh`) is unchanged.
- **The `heartbeat.bind` typed Chat action.** It only returned a gate asking
  the Codex App host to create a heartbeat automation. Removed with it:
  - `goal.create`'s `heartbeat` parameter, which added the same gate after
    the Goal was created; a preview that still sends it is rejected as an
    unknown parameter;
  - the dashboard's **Set up Heartbeat** Goal action, its Goal Heartbeat
    schedule rows and drawer, and their strings.

  In a Goal, a request to keep the Goal moving (for example, "keep this Goal
   moving every day") now goes to the selected Agent in Chat. It no longer
   opens a typed preview or becomes a scheduled check. Bounded recurring checks
   continue to use `monitor.create` and `monitor.update`.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-29 - Fork v0: role-based multi-agent orchestration

Covers the fork's first round, 2026-09-25 to 2026-09-28 (PRs #1 to #29,
136 non-merge commits), and the fixes that followed it.

### Highlights

- **The orchestrator role.** In upstream `peer_v1`, every worker agent plans,
  decomposes and claims work for itself, and a hash picks who owns a replan.
  The fork adds the `role_v1` runtime model, which has three registered roles:
  - at most one **orchestrator** per goal. It clarifies requirements with
    you, plans, owns the acceptance criteria, answers escalations, and is
    the only role-assigned agent that opens user gates;
  - **developers**, which implement todos;
  - **acceptors**, which only review.

  `role_v1` is the default for new goals.
- **A resident dispatcher.** `loopx dispatch serve` launches role Turns when
  state changes and on a periodic tick. It only schedules: every write still
  goes through the existing CLI and kernel contracts.
- **You talk to the orchestrator through gates.** Every user gate has a
  discussion thread. The initial plan arrives as a plan card that you
  approve, and so does an agent's later change to a todo's acceptance
  criteria. `loopx goal create` turns a requirements document into a running
  goal.
- **Review before merge.** A delivery that requires acceptance moves to the
  new `in_review` status. By default, that is developer implementation work
  on a goal that has an acceptor. An acceptor then accepts, rejects or
  blocks it. Accepted work merges atomically across the todo's repos. The
  second rejection of a todo escalates it to the orchestrator.
- The fork also adds multi-repo git workspaces, a push gate, a goal-complete
  gate, per-Turn cost accounting with optional budgets, and a role board in
  the dashboard.
- Two end-to-end pilots on real models validated the full loop
  ([pilot v0](docs/fork/e2e-pilot-report-v0.md),
  [pilot v1](docs/fork/e2e-pilot-report-v1.md)).

### Added

#### Roles and the orchestrator (#4, #7, #27)

- **Roles in the registry.** `coordination.agent_model` is `role_v1` or
  `peer_v1`. `coordination.agent_roles` maps each registered agent to
  `orchestrator`, `developer` or `acceptor`, and a goal has at most one
  orchestrator. Set them with:
  - `loopx register-agent --role ROLE`;
  - `loopx configure-goal --agent-role ID=ROLE`, `--clear-agent-role ID` or
    `--agent-model role_v1|peer_v1`.
- **Role fields in the todo contract.** The contract gains `required_role`,
  `requires_acceptance`, `acceptor_agent`, `reject_count` and
  `task_repositories`, followed later by `delivered_by`, `review_feedback` and
  `acceptance_criteria`. The matching flags:
  - `loopx todo add` and `loopx todo update` take `--required-role`,
    `--requires-acceptance`, `--acceptor-agent`, `--reject-count`,
    `--task-repo` and `--acceptance-criteria`.
  - Only `loopx todo update` takes `--review-feedback` and the clear flags:
    `--clear-required-role`, `--clear-acceptor-agent`, `--clear-task-repos`,
    `--clear-acceptance-criteria` and `--clear-review-feedback`.
- **Role-aware selection.** An agent with a registered role only receives
  todos whose effective role matches its own. An agent without a role keeps
  the flat peer routing. User gates, blockers and planning work belong to the
  orchestrator, so it never receives implementation work. An acceptor
  receives the `in_review` todos it is the resolved acceptor for, and todos
  tagged `required_role=acceptor`.
- **Replan routing.** Replan obligations go to the goal's orchestrator
  instead of the owner that the sha256 peer hash picks.
- **Only the orchestrator opens user gates (#7).** Under role_v1, agents with
  the developer or acceptor role raise `blocker` todos instead. The
  orchestrator answers them itself, or turns them into a gate with options
  and a recommendation. Agents without a role keep the upstream behavior.
- **Less orchestrator overhead (decision 43, #27).** LoopX now completes pure
  bookkeeping without a model Turn: the planning todo once its plan is
  applied, an escalation whose todo is already done, and a gate-reply action
  todo whose gates were already answered. Every claude-code orchestrator Turn
  also starts from a bounded goal state digest (at most 20,000 characters),
  so it needs fewer CLI calls to discover state.

#### Dispatcher (#6, #14, #23, #24)

- **`loopx dispatch serve | status | launchd-plist`.** For each goal and
  agent, a pass asks LoopX's `should-run` whether the agent has work. It then
  applies slots, auth preflight and backoff, and launches
  `loopx turn run-once` with the agent's host flags.
  - Slots: the orchestrator is serial per goal. Developers and acceptors run
    up to their `max_concurrency`, and every Turn counts against a
    machine-wide `--max-global`.
  - Only one dispatcher runs per runtime root. It holds a `flock`, and a
    second one exits with code 3.
  - `launchd-plist` prints a `KeepAlive` job for macOS and installs nothing.
- **Per-todo Turn lanes (decision 32, #14).** One developer can work on
  several todos of the same goal in parallel. A single todo never has two
  Turns at once.
- **Failure handling.**
  - A provider that hits rate limits or its quota backs off on its own:
    60 s, then doubling, capped at 6 h.
  - A todo whose Turns keep failing backs off exponentially.
  - A crashed Turn is replayed with the same Turn identity, so it never
    settles twice.
  - A Turn whose settlement ran out of retries is resumed from its journal
    without calling the host again (#17).
- **Orchestrator action todos.** When the orchestrator has work that no todo
  carries, such as a gate reply, the dispatcher opens one action todo. It
  retires an action todo whose Turns keep failing, and opens a repeat-limit
  gate (#23).
- **Idle heartbeat (#24).** An idle dispatcher prints a heartbeat line every
  `--idle-heartbeat-seconds` (default 900), so it no longer looks dead.
- **System gates.** LoopX itself opens these gates, each through the normal
  Todo API: re-login needed, long provider cooldown, orchestrator repeat
  limit, `acceptor_blocked`, `push_request`, `budget_exhausted` and
  `goal_complete`.

#### Gate threads, plan cards and goal intake (#2, #7, #20)

- **Gate threads.** `loopx gate reply | show | list | resolve`. Every user
  gate has an append-only discussion thread with an awaiting state
  (`awaiting_user` or `awaiting_orchestrator`). Your reply wakes the
  orchestrator, and replying never closes a gate.
- **Plan cards.** `loopx plan propose | show | list | apply`.
  - The orchestrator proposes a plan as JSON: its todos, roles, repos,
    dependencies, acceptance criteria and validation commands.
  - The plan waits on a `plan_approval` gate. The orchestrator revises it in
    place with `--revise`.
  - On approval, LoopX creates the plan's todos, and dependent todos start
    `deferred`. A Markdown goal writes them all in one locked write. A
    canonical goal creates them in order with idempotent operation ids, so an
    interrupted apply resumes without duplicating todos.
- **Criteria changes (decision 40, #20).** A plan card can carry
  `criteria_changes` for existing todos. You see the old and new criteria side
  by side. While the change is pending, the acceptor does not review the
  affected todo.
- **Goal intake.** `loopx goal create --project STATE_HOME --goal-id G
  --doc req.md --repo NAME=PATH --agent ID=ROLE` does the whole setup:
  - bootstraps the goal;
  - registers the requirements doc as an authority source;
  - registers the agents, their roles and the repos;
  - adds the orchestrator's first planning todo.
- **Web gate decisions (#2).** The dashboard's `gate.resolve` now applies
  through the CLI decision path. It supports approve, reject and cancel with
  an optional note (at most 600 characters), and shows a readback afterwards.
  On `acceptor_blocked`, `budget_exhausted` and `goal_complete` gates, each
  button names the option it submits, such as "Approve (raise_budget)", and
  only the options the gate lists are offered.
- **Web discussion panel.** The gate drawer lists the thread and has a reply
  box. Two loopback-only endpoints back it: `GET /api/chat/gate-thread` and
  `POST /api/chat/gate-thread/reply`.

#### Acceptance flow (#8, #11, #13, #16)

- **The `in_review` status.** On a role_v1 goal that has registered roles,
  completing an open agent todo that requires acceptance does not mark it
  done. A goal without roles, and user todos, keep the direct completion.
  Which todos require it:
  - with `requires_acceptance=true`, always;
  - with `requires_acceptance=false`, never;
  - without the flag, only a developer advancement todo, and only when the
    goal has an acceptor: a bound `acceptor_agent`, or a `role=acceptor`
    agent.

  LoopX first runs the todo's declared validation command, then moves the
  todo to `in_review`. It records who delivered it and, for a todo with
  repos, the commit it delivered in each repo (`delivered_shas`).
- **Verdicts.** `loopx todo accept | reject | block-review`. An acceptor's
  Turn result maps to the same verdicts:

  | Turn result | verdict |
  |---|---|
  | `validated_completion` | accept |
  | `repair_required` with a summary | reject |
  | `user_action_required` | blocked |

  - Accept completes the todo. For a todo with repos, it merges first and
    completes the todo only after the merge.
  - Reject reopens the todo for the same developer. The feedback is required,
    and the prompt asks it to name each failed criterion.
  - The second rejection blocks the todo and opens an escalation todo for
    the orchestrator.
- **Per-todo acceptance criteria (G2, #11).** The criteria live in a field
  that only the orchestrator, or the owner without an `--agent-id`, writes.
  Agents without a registered role keep the upstream behavior. Developer and
  acceptor Turns see the criteria every time. Rework instructions go to
  `review_feedback`.
- **Acceptor isolation (G12, #13).** For a todo with `task_repositories`:
  - the acceptor reviews in a throwaway detached checkout of the delivered
    commit, never in the developer's worktree;
  - the merge takes exactly the delivered commit, and a branch that moved
    after delivery blocks the merge;
  - changes the acceptor makes to its checkout are detected, recorded and
    discarded.

  A todo without repos is reviewed in the goal project, as before, and has
  no merge. By default the acceptor runs without a sandbox, so it can build
  and test.
- **The `acceptor_blocked` gate.** When the acceptor cannot review, for
  example because tooling is broken, you resolve the gate with one option:
  `retry_acceptance`, `accept_manually`, `return_to_developer` or
  `cancel_todo`.
- **Dependency release and supersession (decision 37, #16).**
  - On a role_v1 goal, a dependency that requires acceptance releases its
    dependents only once it is accepted. Accepting a todo with repos merges
    it first.
  - To replace or split a todo, run
    `loopx todo supersede --goal-id G --todo-id OLD --by NEW[,NEW2]`. This
    rewires the dependents, and a superseded todo never counts as done.
  - `loopx todo list` explains why a deferred todo still waits
    (`dependency_waits`).

#### Git workspaces, merge and push (#1, #12, #19, #25)

- **Goal repos.** Declare a goal's repos with `loopx configure-goal --repo
  NAME=PATH[,default_branch=B][,merge_target=main|task_branch][,task_branch=B]`.
  A goal without a repo list keeps its legacy single `repo`, which acts as the
  repo `main`.
- **Workspaces.** `loopx workspace prepare | status | merge | cleanup`. A
  todo gets one worktree per selected repo, all on the branch
  `loopx/<goal>/<todo>`. A manual command selects the repos given with
  `--repo NAME`, else the todo's `task_repositories`, else every goal repo.
  The dispatcher prepares workspaces only for todos that name repos.
  - The merge is atomic across the todo's repos: if any repo fails, none is
    merged.
  - Each repo with changes gets a no-ff merge commit with `LoopX-Goal` and
    `LoopX-Todo` trailers.
  - Each repo's merge target is its default branch (`merge_target=main`, the
    default) or a task branch (`merge_target=task_branch`, named
    `loopx-task/<goal>` unless `task_branch` is set).
- **Delivery identity (decision 29, #12).** A multi-repo Turn settles against
  a todo workspace identity. A repo without `origin` gets a local `repo_id`,
  so it works without a fake remote.
- **Push gate (decision 38, #19).** Once all of a goal's work is merged and a
  merge target has goal commits that its remote lacks, one `push_request`
  gate lists them per repo. A repo without a remote is skipped, and a goal
  whose repos are all local opens no gate.
  - Approving it pushes each merge target. It never force-pushes.
  - The orchestrator or you can ask for the gate earlier with
    `loopx goal request-push`.
  - An optional `on_push_command`, such as `gh pr create --fill`, runs after
    each successful push.
- **Goal-complete gate (decision 42, #25).** A finished goal gets one
  deterministic `goal_complete` gate, with no model Turn. It shows the merges,
  the push results, the review counts and the cost. Its options are
  `close_goal`, `add_work` and `leave_open`.

#### Agent and provider configuration, Turn hosts (#3)

- **Provider config.** `<runtime-root>/providers.yaml` defines providers of
  kind `anthropic`, `openai`, `openai-compatible` or `codex-cpa`. Auth is
  `api_key`, `oauth_cli` or `oauth_token`. A provider names an env var, a
  keychain entry or a CLI login, and LoopX refuses secret values in the
  file.
- **Agent config.** Each agent has a file at `<runtime-root>/agents/<id>.yaml`.
  A project can override it field by field in `.loopx/agents/<id>.yaml`. The
  file sets the role, runtime, provider, model, effort, system prompt,
  permission or sandbox mode, `max_concurrency` and extra args.
- **Inspection and preflight.** `loopx agent list | show | validate` and
  `loopx provider list | check`. Before the first launch, the dispatcher runs
  an auth preflight for each agent.
- **The `claude-code` Turn host.** `loopx turn run-once --host claude-code`
  takes `--claude-model`, `--claude-permission-mode`, `--claude-effort`,
  `--claude-system-prompt-file`, `--claude-extra-arg`, `--claude-provider` and
  `--claude-bin`. Each Turn is a fresh `claude -p` session.
- **codex-cli config overrides.** codex-cli gains `--codex-config KEY=VALUE`,
  which is passed through as `-c`, and `--codex-provider NAME`, which expands
  a provider from `providers.yaml`. This is how you use CPA.

#### Usage and budget (#15, #22, #24)

- **Turn usage.** Every claude-code and codex-cli Turn records a `turn_usage`
  block: tokens, cost and host steps when the host reports them, and the
  duration. A Turn that times out or crashes without host accounting records
  its duration only. A crash before the ledger write is recorded when the
  Turn is replayed. The rows go to an append-only
  `<runtime-root>/goals/<goal>/usage.jsonl`.
- **Estimated pricing.** A provider can declare a `pricing` table, which
  estimates the cost of hosts that report no USD, such as Codex through CPA.
- **Reports.** `loopx usage report [--by role|agent|goal|todo|model|day]` shows
  agent-hours, cost and Turns. It also shows the cost per accepted todo, with
  and without the orchestrator's share. The status projection carries the same
  metrics as `turn_usage_summary`, over the latest 5,000 ledger rows.
- **Budgets (decision 41, #22).** Budgets are optional:
  `loopx usage budget --goal G --set USD`.
  - At 80% of the budget, LoopX opens a non-blocking alert.
  - At 100%, a `budget_exhausted` gate pauses the goal's new Turns, and
    running Turns finish. Resolve it with `raise_budget`,
    `continue_without_limit` or `stop_goal`.

#### Dashboard (#9 and later)

- **The role board tab (角色看板).** It opens with a "Waiting on you" list of
  gates and plan approvals. Below that, columns Planned, Assigned, Running,
  In review, Rework and Done are split into orchestrator, developer and
  acceptor swimlanes.
- **Cards.** A card shows its agent, repos, reject count, acceptor,
  acceptance criteria, why it waits on dependencies, and its plan link.
- **The usage strip.** It shows cost, agent-hours, cost per accepted todo and
  the budget share.
- **The gate drawer.** It shows the discussion thread and reply box. While
  it is open and the page is visible, it re-reads the gate every 5 s and on
  focus, so a reply or decision made from the CLI shows up without reopening
  it. Above the thread, a card per gate kind shows what you are deciding:
  - a plan approval shows the plan card, with each todo's contract, and its
    criteria changes, old and new side by side;
  - a push request shows each repo's branch, remote and commits;
  - a budget gate shows the spend against the budget and the default raise;
  - a goal-complete gate shows the review counts, merges, push results and
    cost.

  Decisions are enabled only after a successful read of the gate the drawer
  shows, and only while that gate is open. A failed refresh disables them
  until the next successful read. A part that cannot be read is shown as
  unavailable, never as empty. The role board shows each gate's real kind,
  and `loopx gate show` prints the same plan card.

### Changed

These behaviors differ from upstream.

- **Runtime model.** New goals, and goals that record no model, run
  `role_v1`. Goals that already record `peer_v1` keep the flat peer behavior
  until you run `loopx configure-goal --agent-model role_v1`.
- **Anti-hierarchy validators removed.** `agent_profiles.*.profile_role`
  accepts labels such as `orchestrator`, `manager` and `worker`. On role_v1
  goals, the legacy hierarchy detector no longer treats an
  `agent_profiles.*.role` key as a migration trigger. Its other markers are
  unchanged.
- **Completing a todo.** On a role_v1 goal that has registered roles,
  `loopx todo complete` of a todo that requires acceptance (see the
  `in_review` status above) delivers it to `in_review` instead of marking it
  done. The event log gains `todo_in_review` and `todo_reopened`.
- **Planning obligations.** role_v1 goals no longer derive these upstream
  planning obligations:
  - the vision checkpoint, and the replan for a todo done with no follow-up
    (decision 31, #18);
  - the projection repair for an idle orchestrator, and the periodic-review
    replan (decision 39, #21);
  - a demand from a stale executable Next Action (decision 42, #25).

  Planning review is the orchestrator's job on every Turn instead.
- **Dependency release.** On role_v1 goals, a dependency that requires
  acceptance releases its dependents only once it is accepted (for a todo
  with repos, accepted and merged). A manual `done` or a supersede does not
  count. A dependency without
  acceptance is still satisfied by `done`.
- **Who may write what.** Under role_v1, agents with the developer or
  acceptor role cannot open user gates or write acceptance criteria. After
  planning, a change to a todo's criteria needs a user-approved plan card.
  Only the owner, using no `--agent-id`, may still edit criteria directly.
- **Agent Turns cannot decide user gates.** Every Turn host sets
  `LOOPX_AGENT_TURN=<agent id>` in the environment of the model process it
  starts. With it set, `loopx gate resolve` and
  `loopx todo complete --role user --decision-outcome` refuse to record a
  decision on a user gate, with `gate_decision_refused_in_agent_turn`. The
  orchestrator replies with `loopx gate reply` instead, and only as itself: a
  reply as the owner (the default `--as user`) or with another `--agent-id` is
  refused with `gate_reply_identity_mismatch`. This guards against
  accidental self-approval and is not a security boundary: an agent that
  unsets the variable bypasses it. `issue-fix pr-gate-reconcile --execute`,
  which closes the gate of a merged or closed PR as `system`, is refused too
  when it runs inside an agent Turn and would close a gate.
- **Gate decisions are audited.** A user-gate decision records `closed_by`
  in the gate index, with the surface (`cli`, `dashboard` or `system`), the
  actor (the agent named with `--agent-id`, else `owner`), the agent Turn if
  any, and the time. `loopx gate show` shows it. It
  is written after the decision itself; if the process dies in between, a
  replay of the same decision writes it, marked `replayed: true`.
- **The recorded gate decision wins.** Settlement always runs on the
  decision recorded on the gate, never on the caller's. A
  `todo complete --decision-outcome` replay that names another decision is
  refused with `gate_already_decided` and writes nothing. A replay of the
  recorded decision is idempotent. `gate resolve` on a closed gate still fails
  with `gate_closed`.
- **Turn prompts.** Both built-in hosts now ask for repo-relative paths in
  results, and carry role guidance, acceptance criteria and review feedback.
- **codex-cli errors (N9, #24).** An upstream 5xx, `auth_unavailable`, a
  refused connection or a failed upstream dial is now a retryable
  `provider_capacity` error, so the provider backs off, not the todo. A failed
  Turn also keeps a redacted stderr tail.
- **Verdict feedback (N6, #24).** The summary of a review Turn may be up to
  2,000 characters. `review_feedback` keeps its 600-character contract, and
  the text is fitted with the failed criteria first.

### Fixed

- **Pilot v0 fixes (#10).**
  - The orchestrator's LoopX commands are pinned, and its plan todo is
    validated.
  - A gate that awaits the orchestrator no longer blocks its lane.
  - Validation of a `task_repositories` todo runs in the todo's workspace,
    and fails closed when that workspace is missing.
  - The resolved acceptor can start a delivered review.
  - A rejected delivery's feedback reaches its developer.
  - Accept of a todo with repos merges before it completes the todo.
  - The dispatcher never launches an orchestrator Turn that has no todo.
- **Settlement retries (#17).** A Turn keeps its identity when its settlement
  retries run out, and resumes from its workspace only while that workspace
  still exists.
- **Pilot v1 regressions (#23).**
  - A deferred todo is never launched, and no workspace is cut for it.
  - An orchestrator action todo whose Turns keep failing is retired.
  - The action and budget counters survive a dispatcher restart.
- **Pilot v1 gaps (#24).**
  - N3: the status `todo_index` keeps the goal-state status, and superseded
    cards leave the board.
  - N5: accepted todos are counted by their accept record, and the
    orchestrator's spend is split out.
  - N8: the plan gate text refreshes on `--revise`.
  - N10: an untouched todo branch is fast-forwarded when the todo is
    released.
  - N11, in part: the orchestrator can supersede without the claim owner's
    `--agent-id`.
- **UTF-8.** Git subprocess output is decoded as UTF-8 (#5), and so is the
  keychain launch-env subprocess (#3).
- **Hermetic tests (#29).** Multi-agent delivery tests settle from a private
  linked worktree, so they pass from any checkout.
- **Tests no longer touch the real runtime root.** 23 test modules read or
  wrote `~/.codex/loopx`, leaving goals such as `example-goal` and a
  `repository-change-window/` directory behind. They now use temporary
  runtime roots. A test-session guard refuses audited file operations (open,
  mkdir, remove, rename, listdir and similar) under the real runtime root and
  names the offending test. It covers the test process and Python
  subprocesses that inherit its `PYTHONPATH` and guard environment. It does
  not see stat, lstat, access or readlink calls (so not `Path.exists()`),
  `dir_fd`-relative paths, access through an unpinned symlink alias, Python
  subprocesses that drop that environment, or non-Python subprocesses.
- **launchd dispatcher code.** `loopx dispatch launchd-plist` set only
  `PATH` and `HOME`. With the checkout's `.venv` as the Python, a resident
  dispatcher therefore ran the checkout's current code instead of the
  installed snapshot. The plist now pins `PYTHONPATH` to the LoopX source
  that rendered it. Render the plist again after an upgrade.
- **Owner writes on unclaimed todos.** A plan todo without a `bound_agent`
  has no claim owner, because Turns do not claim todos. Two owner actions on
  such a todo failed, because the owner is not a registered agent:
  - the `accept_manually` option of an `acceptor_blocked` gate. It merged
    the delivery and closed the gate, then stopped with
    `agent_id='owner' is not registered` and left the todo `in_review`;
  - `loopx todo supersede --by` without `--agent-id`.

  An owner write is now attributed to the todo's claim owner, else a
  registered fallback (the blocked acceptor, or the agent that proposed the
  plan), else the orchestrator. Both actions now complete.
- **Push gate and deferred todos.** The automatic `push_request` gate
  counted `open`, `in_review` and `blocked` todos as pending work, but not
  `deferred` ones. A goal whose plan dependents were not released yet could
  therefore be offered for push while that work still waited. A deferred todo
  now keeps the automatic gate closed, as it already did for the
  `goal_complete` gate. An explicit `loopx goal request-push` is unchanged.
- **Plan apply before approval.** `loopx plan apply` applied a plan whose
  `plan_approval` gate was still open. It also applied a plan whose gate was
  recorded `reject`, when the card was not settled yet. A pending or
  applying plan now applies only when its gate is recorded done with the
  decision `approve`. Otherwise the apply fails with `plan_not_approved` and
  writes nothing. A plan that was already rejected or cancelled still fails
  with `plan_not_applicable`. Recovering an interrupted apply is unchanged.
- **Dashboard and CLI deciding the same gate.** A gate can now be decided
  from the dashboard and the CLI in any order:
  - A dashboard decision whose gate another surface closed first is reported
    `stale` and changes nothing, even when the decision matches. Before, it
    could report an option you did not choose.
  - The typed gates (`budget_exhausted`, `goal_complete` and
    `acceptor_blocked`) settle one at a time per gate. Before the effect
    runs, the settlement records the chosen option and its inputs, such as
    the note or the budget raise target. Once that record exists, a retry
    after a crash repeats the first choice with the same inputs, and a
    default budget raise is never applied twice.
  - A settlement that did not finish is no longer reported as applied. The
    dashboard marks the decision `failed` with a typed code, and each code
    says how to recover:
    - `gate_settlement_retry_required`: a failed effect, a failed write or a
      lock timeout. Retry the decision.
    - `plan_apply_recovery_required`: an interrupted plan apply. Retry the
      decision, or run the `loopx plan apply` command it names.
    - `gate_push_failed`: a failed push. The failure is final for that gate;
      approve the follow-up push gate that LoopX opens instead.

### Known limitations

- **`hard_lease` goals.** `in_review` is not supported on canonical
  `hard_lease` goals (decision 33). The default `soft_claim` works.
- **Event-projected todos.** `todo update` does not support event-projected
  todos, which are neither Markdown nor canonical. Delivery and verdicts
  therefore need a Markdown or promoted canonical goal.
- **Role board.** On canonical-authority goals, `running` reflects dispatcher
  Turns only. The todo list inherits the status `todo_index` cap of 240
  items across all goals. Verdict text is not shown on the board.
- **codex-cli orchestrators.** The orchestrator's system-prompt addendum and
  state digest only reach claude-code agents. A codex-cli orchestrator gets
  neither.
- **PyYAML.** PyYAML ships only in the `test` extra, and agent and provider
  config files need it. Install with `uv sync --extra test`, or run
  `pip install pyyaml`.
- **Dashboard from source.** A source checkout without the local install
  needs `npm run build:chat` before `loopx dashboard` can serve the chat
  bundle. `scripts/install-local.sh` builds it into the release.
- **Budgets.** A budget pause never kills running Turns, so spend can end up
  above the budget.
- **Usage recording.** The generic-cli and dsh hosts record no usage. A
  codex-cli Turn that times out before `turn.completed` records its duration
  only.
- **Gate authority.** Agent Turns cannot decide user gates, but this is a
  guardrail, not a security boundary: agents run as your OS user, and an
  agent that unsets `LOOPX_AGENT_TURN` can still decide a gate. `closed_by`
  records who decided each gate. A DSH Turn run through an explicit
  `--dsh-runner` runs in process and does not carry the marker.
- **CLI crash while closing a typed gate.** The CLI closes the gate before
  its settlement records the chosen option. If the process dies between the
  two, the option is not recorded yet, and a retry settles with the option
  that the retry passes.
- **Typed gates with unreadable options.** When the dashboard cannot read a
  typed gate's option list, it disables that gate's decisions. Decide it with
  `loopx gate resolve --option ...` instead.
- **Orchestrator ergonomics.** The orchestrator cannot run
  `todo add --agent-id` for agent todos (N11), so it omits `--agent-id`. Its
  clarification questions may arrive in the plan gate thread instead of a
  separate question gate (N7).
- **Not built yet.**
  - remote-SSH workspaces for AOSP-scale trees;
  - a leasable resource pool;
  - Lark and Telegram channels;
  - the dashboard intake form;
  - accept and reject actions on role board cards.

  Several design docs under `docs/fork/` list further known gaps.
