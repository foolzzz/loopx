"""Guard the goal-start flow when Goal state outlives its registry entry.

A project ``ACTIVE_GOAL_STATE.md`` for a goal id the project registry no longer
declares is not the ordinary "nothing to connect yet" case: continuing would hand
a fresh lane write authority over state an earlier lane left behind, under the
same human-readable id. The routes below are the project goal-state roots
``loopx.state_backup`` archives, so a reset that moved or kept one of them is
detected rather than silently reconnected.

This module owns the whole fence so ``loopx.bootstrap_command_pack`` keeps only
its wiring: one entry point through which every absence route passes, the
operator-facing gate, the packet fields that must disappear over orphaned state,
and the guided transaction's blocking shape.
